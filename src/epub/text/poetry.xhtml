				<span>Far away, far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Far away from here...</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is no worry after joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or away from fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away from here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her lips were not very red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor her hair quite gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her hands played with rings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">She did not let me hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her hands playing with gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is something past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Far away from pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy can touch her not, nor hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Enter her domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Neither love in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps at some day beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Shadows and light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She will think of me and make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All me a delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All away from sight.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Spell</h2>
			<p>
				<span>From the moonlit brink of dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I stretch foiled hands to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O borne down other streams</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Than eye can think to see!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O crowned with spirit-beams!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O veiled spirituality!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My dreams and thoughts abate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Their pennons at thy feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O angel born too late</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">For fallen men to meet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In what new sensual state</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Could our twined lives feel sweet?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What new emotion must</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I dream to think thee mine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What purity of lust?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O tendrilled as a vine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around my caressed trust!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O dream-pressed spirit-wine!</span>
